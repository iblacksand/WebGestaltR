# Installation

With the new version of WebGestaltR, we now require Rust to be installed on your system, as the core computations are written in a new Rust Library. This allows for up to a 15x speedup in GSEA. We can also process more datasets for ORA with less memory usage.

## Steps

1. Install rust according to the instructions here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install the R package from CRAN for the latest version of WebGestaltR

```R
install.packages("WebGestaltR")
```
